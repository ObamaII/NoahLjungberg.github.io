    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>
    <p><i>by William Shakespeare</i></p>
    <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? <br>
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>: <br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>: <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>; <br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm'd: <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, <br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
        When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. <br>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. <br>
    </p>
